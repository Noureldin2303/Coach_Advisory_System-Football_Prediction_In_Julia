 The analytical part is more difficult and requires highly specialized labor. It's not something anyone can do without thinking. An unfocused analyst will miss things, even if he is the best analyst in the world. Football events and results need to be analyzed fairly quickly, helping the club to apply the lessons learned from the game faster. This means less time wasted training on unhelpful exercises, less internal bad habits, that speed leads to stronger play, and the good club wants to take advantage of that moment.  so We will use the Julia programming language to build an analytics system that uses artificial intelligence. and machine learning techniques to help analysts discover match events/results no matter how many such information is and quickly and accurately analyze it and produce the kind of data that a team of analysts could take several hours to obtain.
